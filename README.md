# Graph Visualization Project 🌟

Welcome to the **Graph Visualization Project**! 🎉 This repository provides visual representations of a Python codebase. Here's a brief overview of what each file does:

## 📂 File Descriptions

- **`figure_1.png`**: This is the raw graph visualization with no filtering applied. It's a full snapshot of the project.
  
- **`app.png`**: This file contains the visualization for only the `app.py` files, focusing on the application logic.

## 🛠️ How to Run

- **View the graph**: To generate and view the graph visualization, simply run:

  ```bash
  python graph.py
  ```

- **Save the graph to a file**: If you want to save the graph visualization, use:

  ```bash
  python visualize.py
  ```

That's it! 🎨 Enjoy exploring the visualized codebase!
